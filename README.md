# Confirmed Working
The current version (0.3) has been confirmed to work properly by several people. Build with confidence!

# Install Instructions
Coming soon!

# 3 BOM Variants
There are 3 BOM variants to accomodate the 3 different versions of the Mega Amp 2.0:
* YM2612
* ASIC YM3438
* GOAC YM3438

The original release had a mistake in the BOM where R116 was identified as 1.30k instead of 2.20k. Fortunately this mistake has ZERO noticeable effects on circuit performace. I have since corrected the issue in the BOMs. Thanks to FirebrandX for finding this mistake.

# PCB Finish
There are no special requirements for the finish of this PCB - a 1.6mm PCB with HASL finish is perfectly acceptable for this PCB.
