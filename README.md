# Currently Untested!!!
The current version (0.3) is untested. Version 0.1 was practically identical electrically and worked very well but had the MD-90SM connector misaligned. Version 0.2 was identical to 0.3 except that it was designed in Protel 99SE and never released. I supposed one could say versions 0.2 and 0.3 are technically identical, except that 0.3 is now in KiCad.

# Install Instructions
Coming soon!

# 3 BOM Variants
There are 3 BOM variants to accomodate the 3 different versions of the Mega Amp 2.0:
* YM2612
* ASIC YM3438
* GOAC YM3438

# PCB Finish
There are no special requirements for the finish of this PCB - a 1.6mm PCB with HASL finish is perfectly acceptable for this PCB.
