# Triple Bypass Verison 2
This is a redesign of the fantastic 3bp from dbElectronics. It was a team effort between myself, Retrorgb, Jose Cruz, who did the majorty of the testing. Ace, FirebrandX and Mobiusstrip tech all were part of the group that helped with the redesign inputting ideas and and parts suggestions.  The audio adjustment work was done with the help of the mdFourier tool by Artemio Urbina found here - 
https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/MDFourier.  Bfbii was also a great help in using mdFourier to get the levels to match a model 1 va3.
